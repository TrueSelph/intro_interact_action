This action triggers upon a first-time user message by dispatching an introductory prompt directive to the `persona_response_action`. As a core interact action, it ensures that new users receive an engaging and informative initial interaction. The package is a singleton, and it requires the Jivas library version 2.1.0 and depends on the `persona_interact_action` for executing its introductory directive.
